                    "description": "Matthew Krishanu’s work is shrouded in the fog of memory. Across a series of dreamy, washed-out paintings, he digs up his past and recasts it in canvas and paper.\nTwo boys recur throughout most of the show, the artist and his brother as kids. They sit on boats and horses, swim in rivers and seas, clamber over a Henry Moore sculpture. The works look like family snapshots, faded photos of holidays and daytrips that have been painted from memory. It’s as if painting these moments will somehow bring them back, make them real, permanent.\nIn the most striking works here the boys sit on the vast drooping branches of a huge banyan tree. They’re dwarfed by it, lost in this enormous symbol of India. The paint is dripping down the canvas, leaching away, the memories are fading.\nAll this water and greenery is a legacy. In other works his daughter and late wife climb a tree in Epping Forest, or stare out onto an Essex pond. In water and trees is where these memories, these pasts, coalesce into something tangible, long after they’re gone.\nThe final series of paintings shows Christian churches, priests, nuns and congregations in India and Bangladesh. Krishanu’s mother was a theologian, his father a British missionary. These images are crisper, sharper, firmer than the rest; no fog or haze here, just stark personal history.\nThere’s a temptation to read the Christian works as a comment on religion as a colonising force, or a kickback against the dominance of the white figure in Christian aesthetics. Maybe, but I'm not sure. Instead, they feel like an extension of Krishanu’s excavation of memory, a way of processing the mental images of his past.\nNot all the paintings here are good, some are actually pretty bad, and hazy nostalgic figurative painting has been absolutely everywhere for absolutely ages. But Krishanu’s work is imbued with a deep, soft vulnerability, a tenderness and sadness that just about sets it apart; it’s like watching him trying desperately to hold on to memories, ideas, identities, images that remain, no matter what he does, totally ungraspable.",

That was, in fact, a sexed-up adaptation of Philip K Dick’s dystopian 1958 novella, which played out more like a Cold War thriller than the hovercar-tastic excesses of the film. Nonetheless, its central vision remained the same: a future in which criminals are arrested before they commit a crime thanks to the efforts of seemingly infallible telepaths.\nDavid Haig’s adaptation promises to cleave more closely to the book. But it looks like it will still be very much its own thing, with a new setting, characters and possibly even premise as it follows Dame Julia Anderton, the founder of the Pre-Crime programme, who receives a report saying she will commit a murder.\nTelepaths are not mentioned in the copy, which raises the distinct possibility that in Haig’s adaptation the Pre-Crime division is actually based on AI – something already being discussed as a possibility IRL.\nMax Webster directs this eye-catching opener to the Lyric Hammersmith’s 2024 season, a co-production with Nottingham Playhouse and Birmingham Rep with a cast TBC.",

The Road and track programme involves a mixture of workshops and practical sessions. Workshops will discuss athlete education and discipline specific training and tactics. Practical sessions will involve a 4 hour circuit session, with additional time afterwards working on rollers, mechanics and strength and conditioning.\nThe RSR session content is designed to address techniques and tactics we believe riders competing at youth national competition will benefit from and will support the development of those who aspire to compete internationally as a junior/U23. Your attitude and approach to training, learning skills, and how you contribute to the sessions will be noted by the coaches.\nGive 100% to every task at these sessions!\nWe expect circuit RSR riders to be competing in the National circuit Series in 2024 and aiming towards the national circuit championships, as well as their local circuit races. As well as RSRs, Development Centres and club training sessions are also a vital opportunity for local and regular training sessions so make the most of those.",

                    "description": "‘Waters on a Starry Night’: P. B. Shelley’s Poetic Reflections on Wordsworth\n\nA lecture by Professor Mark Sandy.\n\nTaking place on the eve of The Shelley Conference, this lecture focuses on some of Shelley’s better-known poems collected in Mary Shelley’s 'Posthumous Poems' (1824) and their imaginative response to the poetry of Wordsworth. Shelley as a poet is drawn repeatedly to those clusters of images (celestial bodies mirrored in water, evanescent rainbows, a fading rose or the burnished glow of the sun), which trace out, in Wordsworth’s ‘Ode: Intimations of Immortality’, a profound loss of the ‘visionary gleam’ and sources of possible recompense. Shelley may subject Wordsworth’s hopeful vision to scrutiny, but Shelley’s 'Alastor' and ‘Two Spirits – An Allegory’ continue to find an imaginative resourcefulness in Wordsworth’s poetic vision. This fascination with Wordsworth persists even in Shelley’s last poetic fragment, 'The Triumph of Life', where Wordsworth’s ‘celestial light’ and that of ‘common day’ become, for Shelley, a ‘darkness [that] reillumines’ and obliterates reality.\n\nMark Sandy is Professor in the Department of English Studies at Durham University. He has published extensively on Romantic poetry and its legacies, including the monographs 'Poetics of Self and Form in Keats and Shelley' (2005) and 'Romanticism, Memory, and Mourning' (2013; reprinted, 2019). He has also curated a series of edited collections on Romantic echoes from the nineteenth century to the present day, decadence, Venice and, most recently, the spectral: 'Ghostly Encounters: Cultural and Imaginary Representations of the Spectral from the Nineteenth Century to the Present' (2021), co-edited with Stefano Cracolici. He is currently the editor of 'The Review' for the British Association of Romantic Studies. He held a three-month Research Fellowship at the Armstrong Browning Library (Baylor University, Texas) during spring 2022. His latest monograph, 'Transatlantic Transformations of Romanticism: Aesthetics, Subjectivity and the Environment', was published in 2021. He is currently co-editing a four-volume set on 'Loss, Memory, and Mourning' (forthcoming, 2024) and researching a book-length study, provisionally, titled 'Spectral Presences in Romantic and Victorian Poetry: From Wordsworth to the Brownings'.",

                    "description": "Perhaps more so than ‘Cats’, more so than ‘Phantom’, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘Starlight Express’ is his most quintessentially ’80s musical, its world of highly competitive trains played by people on rollerskates somewhat unimaginable as a product of any other era. When it closed on the West End in 2002, it seemed questionable whether it was ever likely to come back. But a candle has been kept burning via a purpose-built theatre in the town of Bochum, Germany, which has played host to a production of the musical since 1988, and which Webber has used as a sort of lab to make tweaks to the show over the years (including adding a train called ‘Brexit’ a few years back).\nThe Bochum edition is probably a reasonable heads-up as to what to expect for this new UK production, which will convert the Troubadour Theatre in Wembley Park into the Starlight Auditorium and what we’re promised will be an ‘immersive’ take on the show directed byLuke Sheppard of ‘& Juliet’ fame. There are reasonable questions about how long a massive musical is going to last in Zone 4, but it’s certainly got off to a roaring start, extending its booking period during the pre-sale.",

If you’re traveling with kids, don’t forget to go to Legoland Windsor theme park. \r\nFor more information on schedules and prices, consult its official website.",

                    "description": "This review is from 2011; ‘Shrek’ returns to London in the summer of 2023 as a touring production, with a completely different cast.\nIf DreamWorks is going to emulate Disney's success in turning animated kids' movies into live musicals, it needs to find its own Alan Menken. Animations like 'Shrek' or 'How to Train Your Dragon' are lustier, crustier and so much funnier than Disney's classics. But the soul of any stage musical is in its music. It's a shame Neil Diamond wasn't available for the whole job in DreamWorks's first live project: a foot-stamping, all-cast rendition of 'I'm a Believer' ends this jolly green giant of a show on an infectious high which the previous 17 numbers can't quite reach.\nJason Moore and Rob Ashford's improved ex-Broadway production takes 'Shrek's freak-championing generosity of spirit and hammers it home, with a chorus of overweight pigs, wicked witches and other fairytale misfits. But Jeanine Tesori's bland, wistful music, despite soulful moments of '60s pastiche and a witty book and lyrics from David Lindsay-Abaire, just isn't juicy enough to do 'Shrek' justice.\nWilliam Steig's story of an ogre who falls for a princess farts in the face of fairytale conventions. That helps make 'Shrek' a better show for kids than the spectacular but overly sadistic 'Wizard of Oz' currently at the Palladium. If parents can afford to take them, children will love the belching, irreverence and storybook lustre of Tim Hatley's costumes and design. The high point is a certain dragon (voiced tremendously by Landi Oshinowo). Since Broadway she has learned to fly, and circles over our heads to defend her objet d'amour, Shrek's talking Donkey.\nI warmed to Nigel Lindsay's gentle Shrek, stumping wistfully around in pounds of sacking and latex. Amanda Holden's Princess Fiona brings a nice neurotic sharp edge to numbers such as 'I Think I Got You Beat', where Shrek and Fiona, each abandoned at seven, squabble over who had the worse childhood (the show wittily adds their backstories). But Holden's tap-dancing Fiona is more proficient than appealing. And Richard Blackwood's Donkey is doomed to hee-haw in the shadow of Eddie Murphy's voiceover.\nThe hilarious star is Nigel Harman. As dastardly mini-villain Lord Farquaad, he spends most of the show on his knees, doing mind-bogglingly lubricious dance and exercise routines with the aid of a pair of fake little yellow-stockinged legs, which have to be seen to be believed. Post-'EastEnders', Harman has done plenty of meritorious straight theatre (Pinter's 'Caretaker', Richard Greenberg's 'Three Days of Rain'). But it's here as a vertically challenged camp tyrant with delusions of Olivier's Richard III that he truly expresses himself.\nStaged, Steig's twisted fairy tale looks a lot like panto. 'Shrek' has had plenty creative TLC and cash poured in since it closed early on Broadway. Its producers obviously believe that London, with its broader, less reverent musical tastes, will love the ogre - and they may be right. After all, we do have a very long annual history of falling for camp fairytale pastiches featuring fart jokes.",

                    "description": "A group exhibition of cross-generational painters, 'Accordion Fields' presents a selection of works across both of Lisson Gallery’s London spaces. All eight artists, whether born or based in the UK or internationally, initially cultivated their artistic talent in London, studying at one of the city’s prominent arts schools and often in direct dialogue with one another. Across a thirty-year span, the artists have witnessed a multiplicity of socio-political shifts, including London’s evolving relationship with the rest of the UK, Europe and the world, and an evolution in the position of British painting on a global stage. With works in the show spanning densely layered landscapes to compressed portraits and composite re-imaginings of past events, the participating artists together produce a symphony of painterly styles, exploring the indeterminate, liminal and multi-dimensional notions of space.\n\nThe title of the exhibition, Accordion Fields, expresses the very nature of expansion and compression: geographically, as many of the artists have either returned to or moved away from London, and compositionally, with the artists’ specific awareness of, and different approaches to, depicting space or a place. Conceived through a variety of approaches, depicted space within the stretcher is folded, tilted, layered, and peeled away so that depth perception is confused and deferred. In the paintings of Varda Caivano, Sarah Cunningham, Pam Evelyn and Tim Stoner, imagery is often pressed toward the surface of the picture plane, so that an ambiguity between what is representational or abstract space occurs. Elsewhere, figures and forms seen from ambiguous viewpoints are left untethered in disorientating expanses, with undefined borders, such as in the work of Andrew Pierre Hart and Elinor Stanley. In the figuration of Dexter Dalwood and Joseph Yaeger we witness the re-presenting of historical facts and the examination of found imagery. Positioning visual information ‘out of time’, these painters imbue their works with complex coded narratives and psychological tension.\n\nAccordion Fields features work that draws inspiration from a wide array of cultural and historical disciplines, from painters across art history – David Bomberg, Helen Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell and Willem de Kooning ¬– to diverse genres of music and cinematography. Rather than confining their attention to one identity or geopolitical space, or moulding into a movement or neat composition, these eight artists embrace timeless and universal themes that seek to recognise not just their own existence but that of the human spirit, providing these paintings the opportunity to connect with audiences past, present and future.\n\nOther presentations by artists in Accordion Fields include Andrew Pierre Hart’s exhibition, 'Bio-Data Flows and Other Rhythms – A Local Story' at Whitechapel Gallery (opening February 2024), Varda Caivano at Labor, Mexico City (February 2024), Dexter Dalwood debuting his first solo show with Lisson Gallery in London (September 2024), Elinor Stanley in the group exhibition at Nova Contemporary, Bangkok (May 2024), and Joseph Yaeger at Antenna Space, Shanghai (November 2024).",

With the City of London Sinfonia and the Opera Holland Park Chorus.\n\nA miniature masterpiece of love, loss, and transformation. Composed in 1718 for private performance in the gardens of the Duke of Chandos’s palace, Handel’s tragicomic serenata is a beautiful story of love, loss, and transformation. The music is filled with birdsong and murmuring waters as the sea nymph Galatea and the shepherd Acis celebrate their love, enraging the lustful cyclops, Polyphemus. When Polyphemus attacks Acis, the shepherd is transformed into a natural spring, forever part of the idyllic landscape and the tears of his beloved nymph.\n\nLouise Bakker directs Opera Holland Park’s first production of a Handel opera. Former Opera Holland Park Young Artist and alumnus of the Royal Opera’s Jette Parker scheme Michael Papadopoulos conducts, with Anthony Gregory and Elizabeth Karani as the lovers, Acis and Galatea. South African bass‐baritone Chuma Sijeqa takes on the role of Polyphemus, the cyclops driven mad by unrequited passion.",

Woodbury uses recurring motifs such as ashes, palimpsests, and remnants of material culture to evoke themes of absence and memory, and bridge human connection across time.\n\nIn her series, Revised Edition, Woodbury enacts a feminist intervention in the art history canon. On pages torn from the seminal Janson’s History of Art – which entirely omitted artist women from its first 29 printings – she, with sumi ink, paints women back into the history which excluded them. Her work renders the invisible visible.\n\n“When complete, Revised Edition will encompass 617 paintings and will stand as testimony against the erasure of others which reaches deeply into our culture.”\n\nOil paintings from the Broken Spine series continue this same exploration of the vagaries of memory, time, and history. Translucent layers of paint and obscured writing lend an ephemeral quality which suggests the fading, forgetting, and fragmenting of the past. From parchment manuscripts, to authors’ galley proofs, to the current US book banning epidemic — the traces and erasures of thought become part of the process of painting.\n\n“These paintings originated when I was recovering from a fractured spine. Themes of brokenness and repair entered my work, and I began exploring the metaphorical connections between book and body.”\n\nThe series In Place is Woodbury’s personal travelogue, noted in colour rather than writing. Finding a timeworn book specific to the location has become an orienting ritual upon arrival. The pages, swatched in various hues of gouache, record fleeting experiences in the language of color.",

Its intimate stage has witnessed the performances of renowned jazz and soul artists, including Bobby Womack, Amy Winehouse, Adele, D'Angelo, and many others. Originally an old branch of Barclays, the venue exudes a unique charm and character that adds to the overall experience.\n\nthe music:\nThe Alehouse Sessions – curated and devised by Bjarte Eike – is an ever changing and evolving insight into the music of the English 17th century tavern. It gives audiences a window into this tumultuous period through Purcell overtures, English sea shanties, and Scandinavian folk songs thrown in for good measure.\n\nThis diversion from the traditional concert model is what is at the heart of the Sessions. Through the medium of these well‐loved tunes, a story of the period is interwoven into the music making creating a unique environment between audience and performer. Using their own arrangement of the tunes, these ‘Alehouse Boys’ combine this unique format with humour, an unrivalled virtuosity and flare for improvisation.\n\nPractical Information\nPlease note that all tickets to this event are standing by default. This event is strictly 18+.\n\n7pm: doors open\n8pm: last entry\n8.30pm: the alehouse sessions",

The narrative unfolds as suspicions of infidelity lead to tragic consequences, revealing secrets that are not as they initially appear.\n\nRenowned artists Clare Presland, Richard Burkhard, and John Savournin reunite for the revival of John Wilkie's elegant 2019 production of Il segreto di Susanna. Notably, the esteemed tenor David Butt Philip makes his debut as Canio in Martin Lloyd‐Evans's new staging of Pagliacci, conducted by Francesco Cilluffo. Alison Langer shines as Nedda, Canio's disillusioned spouse, while Harry Thatcher portrays her ill‐fated lover, Silvio. Immerse yourself in the world of these timeless operatic masterpieces at this must‐see event.",

And of course, they’re covered in Shonibare’s signature Dutch wax print (colourful fabric inspired by Indonesian printing traditions, traded by the Dutch, ubiquitous in Africa, and now used by Shonibare as visual shorthand for the complex history of colonialism).\r\nThis is what Yinka Shonibare CBE – that Commander of the British Empire title matters – does, what he’s always done: highlight, tear apart and subvert the legacy of British imperialism with directness, colour and wit. The debate around public statues of figures like Churchill and Clive – whose accomplishments came at a terrible human cost, who caused so much pain to the people over whom they ruled – has been raging for years now, and it feels like the flames of its anger abated a while ago. But Shonibare’s installation is a clever, almost joyful reappropriation of historical pain, injustice and trauma.\r\nIt makes for grim if colourful viewing\r\nShonibare has filled the central gallery with architectural models of places of sanctuary – the Amnesty International offices, Tokeiji Temple in Japan which protected women fleeing domestic violence, Peter Mott House in New Jersey which was part of the Underground Railroad – a darkly atmospheric, fragile paean to the need for safety in a dangerous world. In among them is a model of the Bibby Stockholm barge, used by the UK government to hold asylum seekers in cramped, dirty, unsafe conditions. Maybe not all places of refuge are what they seem.\r\nThe final work is a library of books about war from throughout history, all rebound in Dutch wax print. Shonibare is forcing us to ask who writes history, whose perspective is elevated above others, whose lives are worth more, what matters? It makes for grim if colourful viewing.\r\nThe works on canvas here are not his strong suit, and the timeline of his GAS artist residency program is a missed opportunity to amplify the artists he’s done so well to support over the years. And though the rest of the show is good, you can’t help feeling that it’s the exact same idea he’s been churning out for decades. There’s nothing new here, but if you had an idea this good you’d probably overdo it too.",

Drawing functions both as site of exploration and as cementation of her wider iconography as an artist, featuring bodies, landscapes and abstract passages, as well as the ecological and cosmological subject matters that spin out into the rest of the work. From this starting point, she reveals new sculptural objects, including stacked and striated columns of ceramic vessels (produced for a major solo show in Spain last year) as well as wall-hung and floor-based works that combine rope, glass, oils and tactile materials into personal, scented talismans.",
