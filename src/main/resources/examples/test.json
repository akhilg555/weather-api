It would seem that someone has decided to slow down the time to enjoy the stay without hurry, where the order in which they ask for and consume the dishes no longer matter and, where the experience of eating, becomes an original tapas tasting that will not leave anyone indifferent.",

Two distinct fa√ßades, both of them showing the influence of the curve redolent of the work of the Reus-born maestro, arouse our curiosity to go and take a closer look at this beautiful and unique building.\n\nThe architect Salvador Valeri i Pupurull worked on the Casa Comalat from 1909 to 1911, and was clearly influenced by Gaudi's organic forms. Dating from the final phase of the \"modernista\" era, this is a highly original building comprising two fa√ßades with a common element: the Gaudiesque curve. The main fa√ßade, which overlooks Barcelona's Avinguda Diagonal, is made of stone and is more symmetrical and regular in shape. \n\nAt street level, there is an interesting wrought-iron doorway and, above it, a central gallery surmounted by a pinnacle. At the top, a series of openings cut into the fa√ßade and surrounded by stone garlands jut out above the remaining curved balconies with their floral motifs.\n\nCasa Comalat is another of the jewels of Catalan modernism that you can visit in the city of Barcelona.",

                    "description": "The architect Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner was commissioned by Francesca Morera i Ortiz to work on the Lle√≥ i Morera House in 1902. On Passeig de Gr√†cia, 35 (Barcelona) there was an old building, called Casa Rocamora, built in 1864 by master builder Joaquim Sitjas. Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner designed a complete remodel of the existing house using a variety of materials. The project lasted until 1906.\n\nFrancesca Morera i Ortiz inherited that building from her uncle, Antoni Morera i Bus√≥, but she died before seeing the finished work. It was her son, Albert Lle√≥ i Morera, who took charge of the house, giving it the name by which it is known today, Casa Lle√≥ i Morera.\n\nLlu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner remodeled the previous building, making it a truly modernist work of art. The house‚Äôs owner commissioned him to demolish and rebuild the fa√ßade, add three galleries and stone balconies on the different floors, and to design the interior. In order to complete this modernist piece of work, the architect was surrounded by a large group of master artists and craftsmen who were renowned for their creativity, like the sculptor Eusebi Arnau, mosaicist Mario Maragliano and cabinetmaker Gaspar Homar, among others.\n\nThe fa√ßade and the mezzanine were decorated with different types of ornamentation, of which the sculptures by Eusebi Arnau depicting two couples of female figures were the most notable, although they were destroyed in a remodel of the house's ground floor in 1943. On the fa√ßade are repeated allusions to the family's surname Morera (which means mulberry in English) represented through the use of different materials, and symbols of 20th century inventions. The fa√ßade is crowned by a tempietto that exceeds the height permitted by the Barcelona City Council, so the builders had to ask for the necessary construction permit.\n\nAn explosion of modernism is found in the interior, which is one of the best preserved in the city: stained-glass windows, mosaics, ceramics, sculpture, wood, marble, sgraffito... The vestibule and staircase show us the different modernist applied arts that the artists and craftsmen were able to create based on the architect's ideas and instructions.",

Originally constructed in 1875, it underwent a remarkable transformation in 1903 when it was purchased by a wealthy Barcelona businessman named Josep Batll√≥. Recognizing Gaud√≠'s architectural prowess, Batll√≥ entrusted him with a renovation project that spanned from 1904 to 1906.\r\n\r\nThe original essence of the building is most pronounced in its facade, adorned with mosaics that blend stone, glass, and vibrant ceramics. Notably, its nine-iron balconies sport a whimsical, mask-like design. As for the interior, every nook of the house is a testament to artistic ingenuity and imaginative flair. It exudes a remarkable brightness and a riot of colors that truly captivate the senses. Don't miss the opportunity to ascend to the roof, which resembles the scales of a dragon, earning Casa Batll√≥ the affectionate nickname, \"the house of the dragon.\"\r\n\r\nHistorically, Casa Batll√≥ served as both the Batll√≥ family's residence and featured apartments for rent. Since 2002, it has opened its doors to the public, regularly hosting events throughout the year.\r\n\r\nCasa Batll√≥ is hailed as a jewel of modernism and one of Gaud√≠'s most original creations, making it an absolute must-visit during your Barcelona sojourn.

The exhibition will show how T√†pies integrated many of the attitudes, images and techniques used by these artists into his language, and into the Western tradition that belonged to him. It is not a process of mimesis, but of assimilation of a way of working, and also of a vision of the world that the Japanese tradition has managed to preserve in temples and gardens, poems and calligraphies, ceramics and paintings.",

                    "description": "Casa Amatller stands as one of Barcelona's remarkable modernist architectural treasures, a creation by the visionary architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch. This architectural marvel was commissioned by the Amatller family, renowned for their involvement in the chocolate industry.\r\n\r\nThough the building's origins trace back to 1875, it wasn't until 1898 that Antoni Amatller acquired it to transform it into his residence, which he occupied until his passing in 1910. His daughter, Teresa Amatller, continued to call this house home until her own passing. Eventually, the property was entrusted to the Fundaci√≥n Instituto Amatller de Arte Hisp√°nico. In March 2015, it was opened to the public, becoming the Amatller House Museum.\r\n\r\nCasa Amatller's transformation marked the birth of modernist architecture along Paseo de Graci√†, revolutionizing the cityscape. The house's interior and exterior are adorned with intricate details reflecting the owner's three primary passions: collecting, photography, and travel.\r\n\r\nThroughout the residence, priceless works of art collected during the owner's global travels grace the space. In 1990, pioneering features for the era‚Äîsuch as an elevator and electric lighting‚Äîwere installed, demonstrating the commitment to modernity.\r\n\r\nThis section of Paseo de Graci√† is famously known as the \"Manzana de la Discordia\" (Block of Discord), where a trio of modernist masterpieces graces the same fa√ßade: Casa Batll√≥ by Antoni Gaud√≠, Casa Amatller by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and Casa Lle√≥ Morera by Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner. These architectural gems vie for the title of the most beautiful, a nod to the Greek mythology tale where goddesses competed to possess the golden apple of beauty.\r\n\r\nCasa Amatller stands as a modernist jewel that should not be overlooked during your visit to the city. Be sure to drop by the caf√© for a taste of Amatller Chocolate's original recipe. For details on visiting hours and pricing, please refer to their official website.",

With a 1.5 km length, it begins in Pla√ßa de Catalunya and ends in Jardinets de Graci√†.\n\nUntil the 16th century, it was an area far from the city and with little population. It was not until the 17th century when it began to develop continuously with the construction of manor houses of the bourgeoisie or convents. Later, the arrival of the industrial revolution favoured the growth of the area due to the installation of many factories. Thus, over the centuries this area grew and became part of the city of Barcelona in 1897 due to the large population that began to live here.\n\nPaseo de Graci√† is today one of the most cosmopolitan and attractive neighbourhoods in the city, full of life with cultural and artistic activities. Besides being an exclusive area of ‚Äã‚Äãluxury shops, restaurants and bars, it has great historical value and importance.\n\nPaseo de Graci√† shows Catalan modernism in every corner. In this avenue are located Casa Lle√≥ Morera, Casa Amatller, Casa Batll√≥ and Casa Mil√°, the jewels of modernist architecture of the time. Also, the benches, street lamps, gardens, or the paving of the ground have surprising modernist decorative elements that can be discovered while strolling and wandering through its streets full of history and art.",

The family lived on the main floor. Following his style, Gaud√≠ created a building whose fa√ßade seems to be in motion, imitating the waves of the sea. Also called \"La Pedrera\" for its stone fa√ßade, its 32 balconies made of scrap metal stand out, which was a groundbreaking material for the contemporary architecture at the time in Spain.\nRegarding interior decoration, it is also Gaud√≠'s work. Modernist style furniture, typical of the life of a bourgeois Barcelona family during the first third of the 20th century.\n\nIt is a total of six floors with a roof terrace. During your visit, you can enjoy an inside permanent exhibition of the work of the architect Gaud√≠. Or go up to the roof that will allow you to be amazed at the architecture and the views of the Paseo de Graci√†.\n\nCasa Mil√° was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984 and without a doubt a must-see on your visit to the city of Barcelona.",

The project was signed by Gabriel Borrell, but it was builded by the architect and writer Manuel Sayrach, the son of the project developer. Sayrach hadn't completed his degree at the time he is thought to have devised this interesting building which reveals the clear influence of Gaud√≠ in the use of the curve.\n\nThe rounded corner of the building is surmounted by a slender turret. Another outstanding element is the protruding balcony with columns and large windows. Inside the building there is a lavishly decorated lobby and staircase.",
